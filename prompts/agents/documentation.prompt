2. Extract key components from chat history
3. Format strictly using this template:
{
  "Platform": "[cloud/local]",
  "Component 1": "[name]",
  "Component 2": "[name]",
  ...,
  "Implementation difficulties": [1-10],
  "Maintenance difficulties": [1-10]
}
4. Verify all fields are populated
5. Output ONLY the JSON block
